# HTTP from Scratch
The purpose of this repo is for me to learn how to implement RFC 9112 (HTTP/1.1).
I am starting with python (a language I am comfrotable with - to remove any mental blockers for now).

After I get to implement a good chunck of the things that I want to do (list is below), I will move to something like Go, Rust or Zig (for learning purposes).


# What do I want to implement?
- [ ] Echo HTTP server that adheres to RFC 9112 (HTTP/1.1)
- [ ] Simple Reverse proxy
- [ ] Optimize the amount of requests the server can handle.
